This repository contains data access and computational analyses for the methods developed in our snAP-seq manuscript (*under review*).

## Data

All the raw sequencing data, snAP-seq sites and peaks have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI under accession number [E-MTAB-XXXX](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-XXXX).


## Code

- [Synthetic oligonucleotide experiments](oligo.md): exploring synthetic and 5-hmU N-oligo libraries.
- [snAP-seq in *Leishmania major*](leishmania.md): analysis after SMUG1 and UNG treatments.
- [snAP-seq in *HeLa* cell line](hela.md)
