This repository contains data access and computational analyses for the methods developed in our [snAP-seq manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-019-0279-9)

## Data

All the raw sequencing data, snAP-seq sites and peaks have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI under accession number [E-MTAB-7152](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7152)


## Code

- [Synthetic oligonucleotide experiments](oligo.md): exploring synthetic and 5-hmU N-oligo libraries
- [snAP-seq in a parasite genome](leishmania.md): mapping snAP sites after SMUG1 and UNG treatments in *Leishmania major* and downstream analyses
- [snAP-seq in the human genome](hela.md): mapping AP peaks in APE1 knock down and wild type HeLa cell line
